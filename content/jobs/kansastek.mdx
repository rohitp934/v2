- Researched different methods of identifying Candidate Malpractice in Online Interviews particularly through multiple windows open on their device.
- Compared and contrasted different suitable object detection models for detecting multiple windows, Tensorflow Object Detection (Inception RCNN, MobileNet, ResNet) and PyTorch (YoloV4, YoloV5).
- Labelled and trained a custom object detection model using transfer learning with MobileNet and deployed as a Flask REST API on Kubernetes with Docker.
